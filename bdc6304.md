# Review of Robust Modeling and Optimization

## What we study - modeling and optimization under uncertainty
For Optimization, we need to decide decision variables, constraints and objective functions. 
When involving uncertainty, first, we use random variables to describe uncertainty. Then we need to find a way to incorporate uncertainty into
decision variables, constraints and objective functions. The decision variables could be a function of random variables and the random variables
could also be affected by decisions. For constraints, we could require some constraints with random variables holds with probability one, or 
chance constraints, or risk constraints. For objectives, it could be the expectation, or risk, or worst-case objective in some sense. 

- Endogeneous uncertainty vs. exogeneous uncertainty
- Nonanticipativity for both decision variables

- constraints: robust constraints; chance constraints; risk constraints;

- objectives: robust; expected; risk;
