This is an introductory lecture designed to introduce people from outside of Computer Vision to the Image Classification problem,
and the data-driven approach. The Table of Contents:
## Image Classification

**Motivation**. In this section we will introduce the Image Classification problem, which is the task of assigning an input image 
one label from a fixed set of categories. This is one of the core problems in Computer Vision that, despite its simplicity, 
has a large variety of practical applications. Moreover, as we will see later in the course, many 
other seemingly distinct Computer Vision tasks (such as object detection, segmentation) can be reduced to image classification.
